# Planet_Observance_Final
This is the Finishing Product ( For now) of Planet Observance

This Program is developed to be able to catalouge planets into the system : its name, age , size and other technical information for navigators and any other explorers 
to be able to check.

  At the moment, There are two main roles to this program : The Classifiers and the Navigators :
  
  1). The Classifiers:

    .Have admin privleges and are able to create and add more users
    . Are able to view all users and all of their credentials 
    . Are able to Classify and catalouge planets for all to see
    . Are able to Search, Update and Delete any specific User they wish
    
  2). The Navigators:

    - Have no Admin Priveleges and Cant tamper with existing accounts
    - Can view all users but with limitations
    - Are only able to view planets and not add them
    - Is able to modify its own account only (change in password, name and race)
    

This Application will see more improvement where we soon create :

    - A Distance measurement system
    - A more intuitive menu
    - A Tracking of time in different locations
    - A report of habitability 
    - A GUI system to compliment the program
